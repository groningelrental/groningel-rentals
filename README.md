## 🔧 API Integration

### Current Implementation
The platform currently uses real scraped data with a mock API structure designed for easy backend integration.

### Data Sources Research

**Public APIs Available:**
- ❌ **Pararius**: No public API, scraping required
- ❌ **Funda**: Partner API only, requires business agreement
- ❌ **Kamernet**: No public API
- ❌ **Nijestee**: No public API, internal housing corporation system

**Recommended Backend Approach:**
1. **Web Scraping Service**: Automated scrapers for each platform
2. **Caching Layer**: Redis/database for performance
3. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connections for live updates
4. **Rate Limiting**: Respectful scraping with proper delays

### API Structure

```typescript
interface Property {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  price: number;  // 0 for "Price on request"
  location: string;
  size: string;
  rooms: number;
  source: string;
  sourceUrl: string;
  listedDays: number;
  image: string;
  description: string;
  type: string;
  available: string;
  realEstateAgent?: string;
  neighborhood?: string;
  buildYear?: string;
  interior?: string;
}
```
